# SLF-Tree-Analysis
My Final Biostatistics Project published as a portfolio with annotated code.

This project was for my BIOSC 1120 Biostatistics class taken at the University of Pittsburgh in Fall 2023. We had to choose a dataset to do statistical analysis on for said final project. I had settled on the nesting and egg laying habits of Spotted Lanternflies (*Lycorma delicatula*). I wanted to determine if there any correlations with their egg laying habits based on the species and the sizes of the host trees.
